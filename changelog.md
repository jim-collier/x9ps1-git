# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

- *With the exception of much older entries, which A) didn't use this convention, and B) have been edited down for brevity since much of the code discussed has been long-gone since before putting the project on github. This more standardized changelog format wasn't followed until 2025-07-10. Anything older than that is a tossup.*

## v1.0.1 build 1n1bed5 - 20260526

### Notes

This is a significant refactor - in scope, but not so much actual effort. It encapsulates many ideas - and addresses some sore spots - that I've wanted to get to for years.

It's also a revisit to an idea this library started out as long ago: a dynamic includable library. But the implementation long ago was severely flawed, with a poor understanding at the time of the subtleties of bash script mechanics and gotchas, that only >decade of working with it can hammer into the heads of old programmers that find it hard to let go of "the way things *should* work".

To be fair, it's also difficult to let go of some outmoded ideas of what shell script even "is" or can do, after:

- Decades of writing absolutely torturous DOS `.bat` files and Windows `.cmd` "scripts", if you can even call the language that.

- Being confidently informed by expert blogs and StackExchange posts online - and foolishly believing it - that Bash scripts are "supposed" to be POSIX-compliant - thus crippling the actually pretty powerful Bash language - to something weak, brittle, and effectively frozen in 1988. (Old enough to rent a car in the US since 2023. Old enough to drink since 2019. Old enough to vote since 2016.)

### Added

- Added `install_dev.bash` [20260614]

- Added `install.bash`. [20260526]

- Added functions `fBgrep()` [_a bash-native `grep -E [-iov]`_], `fBgrepQ()` [_bash-native `grep -Eq [-iov]`_], `fBhead()` [_bash-native `head`_], `fIsNameref()`. [20260524]

- CI/CD scripts. [20260519]

### Changed

- Renamed entire project from clunky "x9bash5-template", to "bash5-marmot". Inner rationale in [Issue #3](https://github.com/jim-collier/bash5-marmot/issues/3). [20260526]

	- Tests and CICD pipeline still works.

- Made `fError*` -related functions simpler and more robust. [20260523]

- Refactored to be modular dynamic libraries instead of one monolithic static template.

	- *There's still a required template though to implement required module interfaces, it's just a much smaller script overall. And modular.*

- Fixed linter errors.

### Other work

- Changed licence of CICD scripts from GPL2 to MIT. [20260520]

## v10.0.0-beta2 - 2026-04-09

### Changed

- Fixed errors highlighted by linter in some docs.

- Added some to-dos.

## v10.0.0-beta1 - 2025-07-11

### Notes

As of 2025-07-11, this is the biggest update in 14 years, possibly 17 (and its first time on github).

Many of the changes involve embracing slowly moving to more native Bash idioms (and v5 idioms), and a higher reliance on native idioms in general - which allowed for simplifying and removing functions.

(But there are still plenty of functions that could/should easily get the axe with little pain or possibly even notice. Possibly even some that were written just for this version.)

Since this script is moving towards more idiomatic standards-compliance anyway, it might as well also move to github, standardized project file structure, and semantic versioning.

### Added

- Added unit testing functions back in [re-created actually], simpler and lighter-weight. [≅2025-07-06 to 11]
- Brought debugging/profiling functions back in from older bigger template branch. (Profiling = tracing code paths, but not counting and timing....yet.) [≅2025-06]
- Added simple suite of generic logging functions. (Rather than refactoring much older more complicated logging code from a many-years-old branch of this template.) Logging is a great candidate for a set of generic functions, as it is frequently needed and can consume a lot of lines of code doing the same thing in every script, often in slightly different ways. [≅2025-06]
- A pretty useful collection of functions to scan a filesystem by one or more specific object types [including broken links], and narrow-down the results with successive passes of include or exclude regex filters. [≅2025-07-01 to 12]
	- This could be - and is - done with simply with `find` and multiple passes of `grep -E`. But these functions wrap that in a reasonably simple, clean, and lightweight way that still makes it worth the effort. In the future it may integrate with a filesystem "records & fields"-based toolset in the works that can deal with things like xattrs, EXIF/XMP, and advanced filenaming (including basing filenames on metadata - *or vice-versa*.)
- Created or added back in from older templates and refactored, several once-discarded functions that were missed. [≅2025-07-06 to 11]
- Added reentrant startup routing back in, this time much simpler and more sane, having learned lessons from previous efforts at "auto-routing" reentrant templates. [≅2025-07-06 to 11]
	- Can now relaunch as any user, not just sudo.
	- The [re]entry and exit points make a lot more sense now.
- Checking for dependencies is now much easier, with dedicated functions. [≅2025-07-10]
	- That themselves, internally, are horribly convoluted in order to create and test fRecord_*() along the way. They could have just been very simple string manipulations.
- Added a HEREDOC section illustrating generic function usage examples. [≅2025-06]
- Added some associative array handling functions, fRecord_\* and fAssArr_\*. Although conceptually cool in the context of limited Bash, they're probably pretty slow in large loop contexts, so maybe don't use for performance-critical bottlenecks. (Line-delimited strings at best, or multiple arrays with matching integer indexes at worst, is probably the better performance-preserving alternative.)  [≅2025-07-06 to 11]

### Changed

- Improved error-handling [≅2025-07-06 to 11]:
	- `fThrowError()`
		- Now outputs the full relevant call stack.
			- *Now there's no need to add `"${FUNCNAME[0]}"` to every call to `fThrowError()`, yay!*
		- Doesn't necessarily exit, in some cases returns non-0.
		- Error message is simpler and goes to `stderr` rather than `stdout`.
		- Sets global `$_ErrVal` so that the value persists longer (or even at all), for detection/inspection by callers. Although it gets reset when error-handling changes, calling code should set it `=0` before calling something it wants to check afterward.
- Instead of returning boolean values by echo (either integers `0|1` or the even more ancient strings `"true"|"false"`), they do it the bash way: `return 0` for success, `1` for non success, or `>2` for error if possible. [≅2025-07-06 to 11]
	- Functions that modify values (eg trim a string), take a variable *nameref* (e.g. `local -n callerVar=$1`), and update its value in-place. (But within the function, vis-a-vi a temp variable so that the setting of result is atomic only on success, or possibly after an initial setting of default in case of error.)
	- Functions that "return" a value of a fundamentally different type than input (e.g. integer to string date), also take a *nameref* for return value, but also an additional parameter (usually read-only) as input for the value to transform into output.
	- If the function accepts multiple inputs that may be so memory-large that making a copy might be crazy inefficient especially inside a loop, it may accept more than one variable *nameref*.
	- Bash isn't very helpful with error messaging when you forget to provide a *nameref*. So efforts are made to validate *nameref* arguments and throw better errors.
- For fCopyright(), fAbout(), and fSyntax(): Changed back from HEREDOC format to fEcho_Clean. [≅2025-06]
	- HEREDOC, while easier to work with on the surface, is actually too hard for most editors to work with - vis-a-vis mix of tabs and spaces for script-formatting vs output indenting. It's just not worth the constant fuss, unless it's just a big blob of unindented paragraphs.
- Refactored or rewrote at least a dozen existing functions, to be simpler and more bash-idiomatic. [≅2025-06 to 07]
- Moved this changelog out of the template itself, and into this doc. (And reversed the chronology, and converted to md format.)
- Added the venerable flag 'doPromptToContinue' back in! Thought it would never happen. But along with 'doQuietly', which is now longer rendundant, is a quick an easy way to add prompt-to-contiue-ing in and out with ease.
- Renamed most \_f*() functions to just f*() for user-fliendliness.
- Moved unit testing out of main template, now 'source' template from testing scripts.
- Tested main template needed modification to be able to run "sourced" from one or more unit-testing files. (No changes needed.)
- Split single copyright notice into two: one for template consumer & script author, second for 'based on' template author.
- Improved help comments in fParseArgs().
- Updated some old counter increment styles to e.g. ((counter++)).
- Moved some function groups around so that the two most core, integral groups [e.g. fEcho*() and error-handling] are at the bottom in their own group, but in otherwise in the main generic section, the easiest to delete appears lowest.
- Added function group header fields 'Can be deleted?' and 'Statefulness'.
- Moved error-handling set-up directly underneath error-handling functions.
- Added fDefineTrap_Error_ExitOnThrow() for future use with 'set +e' (which will probably never migrate too as the developer overhead is too damn high).
	- Instead, significantly mitigate with `set -e` with `set -E`, `set -o pipefail`, and `shopt -s inherit_errexit`.
- Added `set -u`, which required a significant amount of refactoring (mostly via search and replace) to give all numbered args default empty values, e.g. "${1:-}". That didn't change any existing expected behavior. Existing unit tests still pass.

### Removed

- Removed or refactored most or all *_byecho() functions. [≅2025-07]
- Moved several low-use functions to an out-of-repo 'extras' script that will probably be forgotten. [≅2025-07-06 to 11]

- Changed everything beginning with "__" to "_"
- Added to the end of every "function(){" statement:
- Begin to change use of "${variable}" to just "$variable" to quicken dev and improve readability.
- Begin use of bash built-in $FUNCNAME.
- Appended "1" to every library function so that:
	- Maintain backward compatibility when copy/pasting everything below a certain line to provide "library" updates to legacy scripts.

	_fNormalizeDir1_byecho()
- \_fstrAppend1_DEPRECATED_byref()
	- Added a message to not use it (so it won't break existing scripts if template code updated).

## 20171217

- Ill-fated, short-lived start of 0_library_v3 fork, that was going to refactor most functions to work more consistently, but too non-idiomatically. (E.g. everything would return literal "true", "false", or "error", with useful values returned in named variables.)

## 20171217

- Created generic logging functionality.

## 20170314

- Forked to 0_library_v1, leaving now 'legacy' 0_library intact as its referenced by many scripts.

## 20161003

- Created 'fPackedArgs*()' functions to solve the problem of quoted arguments getting unquoted with multiple passes among programs and scripts (especially sh, with its limited number of directly [non-shift] addressable args).

## 20160925

- Moved some bare-bones necessary code out of 0_library back to here.
